# Streamlit App for the Churn exploration and prediction model
## This is a main product for all customers 
### To explore a separate product only for customers with a Month to Month contract type open [this app]( https://churn-prediction-telco-monthly.streamlit.app).

This project is a part of my [Churn Value classification](https://github.com/NuriaAk/Customers_churn_value_classification) machine learning project.
It is a web application made with a [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) framework. 
Data used in this project is from [IBM Telco dataset](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/businessanalytics/blogs/steven-macko/2019/07/11/telco-customer-churn-1113).

Try my app [here](https://churn-prediction-telco-all.streamlit.app)!
